This file contains things I note as I go through the analysis but don't keep in the main code

First bit, looking at the differences in numbers between this and and the poster I note a few updates
Firstly there appears to have been some curation performed so SRST2 now works marginally better, that said it seems to cause issues for assemblers
StrA and strB genes appear to have been renamed to fit in with the rest of the aminoglycoside nomenclature
There is a new QNR issue
