# bioinformatic_fake_news

This is the code for **Bioinformatic fake news: caveats of identifying resistance genes from whole genome sequencing data**
Each folder contains code pertaining to a specific section of the paper. In each folder, there is a primary ipython notebook which walks through the code in the folder. These are commented in much more detail as to wht each 

### db_analysis -> Database comparison
**Primary notebook: db_related.ipynb**

##### Tasks in Notebook
1. to rename elements of each database into a format which can be handeled by all 4 programs
2. to state how each database was then processed by each program (including example commands)
3. to compare the contents of the CARD and Resfinder databases
4. finally it contains code to analyse the ABRicate output using both the Resfinder and CARD databases to compare the differences between the two and produce figure XXX

##### Additional elements
This folder includes several files: The prepared databases (resfinder_20191001_formatted.fasta , card_20191023_formatted.fasta ) and ancilliary files explaining links between the two and element names. This folder also contains the original databases and several legacy resfinder databases, in order to produce figure XXX which describes how the errors are database dependent

### method_analysis -> Comparing the four different bioinformatic tools
**Primary notebook: method_related.ipynb**

##### Tasks in Notebook


##### Additional Elements


BioRxiv/DOI still awaited
